                            Synthesis based on transformers, which does not
                            require explicit 3D priors. Given a single source

                            synthesize plausible novel views that exhibit high
                            fidelity (right). For comparison,

Is a geometric model required to synthesize novel views from a single image?
  Being bound to local convolutions, CNNs need explicit 3D biases to model
  geometric transformations. In contrast, we demonstrate that a
  transformer-based model can synthesize entirely novel views without any
  hand-engineered 3D biases.
  This is achieved by (i) a global attention mechanism for implicitly learning
  long-range 3D correspondences between source and target views, and (ii) a
  probabilistic formulation necessary to capture the ambiguity inherent in
  predicting novel views from a single image, thereby overcoming the
  limitations of previous approaches that are restricted to relatively small
  viewpoint changes.
  We evaluate various ways to integrate 3D priors into a transformer
  architecture.
  However, our experiments show that no such geometric priors are required and
  that the transformer is capable of implicitly learning 3D relationships
  between images.
  Furthermore, this approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of visual quality
  while covering the full distribution of possible realizations.

  Given the ever-increasing computational costs of modern machine learning models, we need to find new ways to reuse such expert models and thus tap into the resources that have been invested in their creation. Recent work suggests that the power of these massive models is captured by the representations they learn. Therefore, we seek a model that can relate between different existing representations and propose to solve this task with a conditionally invertible network. This network demonstrates its capability by (i) providing generic transfer between diverse domains, (ii) enabling controlled content synthesis by allowing modification in other domains, and (iii) facilitating diagnosis of existing representations by translating them into interpretable domains such as images. Our domain transfer network can translate between fixed representations without having to learn or finetune them. This allows users to utilize various existing domain-specific expert models from the literature that had been trained with extensive computational resources. Experiments on diverse conditional image synthesis tasks, competitive image modification results and experiments on image-to-image and text-to-image generation demonstrate the generic applicability of our approach. For example, we translate between BERT and BigGAN, state-of-the-art text and image models to provide text-to-image generation, which neither of both experts can perform on their own.

  To tackle increasingly complex tasks, it has become an essential ability of neural networks to learn abstract representations. These task-specific representations and, particularly, the invariances they capture turn neural networks into black box models that lack interpretability. To open such a black box, it is, therefore, crucial to uncover the different semantic concepts a model has learned as well as those that it has learned to be invariant to. We present an approach based on INNs that (i) recovers the task-specific, learned invariances by disentangling the remaining factor of variation in the data and that (ii) invertibly transforms these recovered invariances combined with the model representation into an equally expressive one with accessible semantic concepts. As a consequence, neural network representations become understandable by providing the means to (i) expose their semantic meaning, (ii) semantically modify a representation, and (iii) visualize individual learned semantic concepts and invariances. Our invertible approach significantly extends the abilities to understand black box models by enabling post-hoc interpretations of state-of-the-art networks without compromising their performance.

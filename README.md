### Demo

For a quickstart, you can try the [Colab
demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CompVis/geometry-free-view-synthesis/blob/master/scripts/braindance.ipynb),
but for a smoother experience we recommend installing the local demo as
described below.

#### Installation

The demo requires building a PyTorch extension. If you have a sane development
environment with PyTorch, g++ and nvcc, you can simply

```
pip install git+https://github.com/CompVis/geometry-free-view-synthesis#egg=geometry-free-view-synthesis
```

If you run into problems and have a GPU with compute capability below 8, you
can also use the provided conda environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/CompVis/geometry-free-view-synthesis
conda env create -f geometry-free-view-synthesis/environment.yaml
conda activate geofree
pip install geometry-free-view-synthesis/
```

#### Running

After [installation](#installation), running

```
braindance.py
```

will start the demo on [a sample scene](http://walledoffhotel.com/rooms.html).
Explore the scene interactively using the `WASD` keys to move and `arrow keys` to
look around. Once positioned, hit the `space bar` to render the novel view with
GeoGPT.

You can move again with WASD keys. Mouse control can be activated with the m
key. Run `braindance.py <folder to select image from/path to image>` to run the
demo on your own images. By default, it uses the `re-impl-nodepth` (trained on
RealEstate without explicit transformation and no depth input) which can be
changed with the `--model` flag. The corresponding checkpoints will be
downloaded the first time they are required. Specify an output path using
`--video path/to/vid.mp4` to record a video.

```
> braindance.py -h
usage: braindance.py [-h] [--model {re_impl_nodepth,re_impl_depth}] [--video [VIDEO]] [path]

What's up, BD-maniacs?
